       "      <td>The World Needs Peacemaker Trump Again \\n\\n by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:\\n\\nThe world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.\\n\\nThese “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.\\n\\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\\n\\nThere has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”\\n\\nLast year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.\\n\\nChina is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.\\n\\nUkraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.\\n\\nOn October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.\\n\\nAs Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?\\n\\nTo further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.\\n\\nTo retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\\n\\nAs the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”\\n\\nIt is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”\\n\\nBiden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.\\n\\nNot content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.\\n\\nAs the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.\\n\\nRead More @ TheLibertyDaily.com</td>\n",

       "      <td>Desperation and Diplomacy: North Korea's Tech Hunt in Russia Amid Sanctions \\n\\n For several decades, North Korea has masterfully balanced its relations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia, maintaining a relationship with the latter that is both complex and ever-changing.\\n\\nThe dynamics have shifted notably since Russia found itself sanctioned and isolated by the international community following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\\n\\nSince then, North Korea and Russia have grown increasingly close, as recently seen when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited eastern Russia, where he held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.\\n\\nAfter a six-day visit, Mr. Kim returned to Pyongyang on Sunday.\\n\\nSanctioned by the international community, North Korea desperately needs Russian technology for nuclear weapons, satellite development, and food production.\\n\\nSimilarly, Russia, also facing sanctions, urgently seeks to replenish its dwindling front-line supplies with large quantities of ammunition from North Korea.\\n\\nBefore the summit, when asked whether Russia would assist North Korea in developing artificial satellites, Mr. Putin confirmed this was a primary reason for their meeting.\\n\\nBoth sides appear willing to overlook the threat of escalated international sanctions against them.\\n\\nDuring their summit, Mr. Kim vowed to “fully and unconditionally support” Moscow.\\n\\nRocket technology holds particular interest for Mr. Kim and his regime.\\n\\nFrom Outward Support to Clandestine CyberattacksAccording to reports, North Korea has long eyed Russian technology, resorting to cyber theft to obtain it, and it is something that Moscow now appears ready to overlook despite recent reports such as one by Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC).\\n\\nThe MTAC report indicates that between March last year and this March, North Korean cyber operatives launched attacks on Russian aerospace research facilities and penetrated academic institutions engaged in research. Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.\\n\\nThe study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.\\n\\nThe hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.\\n\\nSPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.\\n\\nExperts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits. These cyber activities appear crucial in advancing the country’s space technology.\\n\\nAdditionally, the report disclosed that in 2020, North Korean hackers penetrated the internal network of Russia’s Almaz-Antey, a leading manufacturer of surface-to-air missiles. The intruders pilfered various information, including developer personal data and proprietary details on missile components.\\n\\nIn 2019, North Korean cyber operatives also exfiltrated design blueprints from Russia’s Uralvagonzavod tank factory, the entity responsible for producing Russia’s next-generation T-14 Armata battle tank.\\n\\nMoreover, the report highlighted the frequency of North Korean cyber-attacks against Russian defense corporations specializing in avant-garde weapon systems like hypersonic technologies and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).\\n\\nMilitary commentator Xia Loshan told The Epoch Times on Sept. 10 that both North Korea and Russia are in a desperate situation.\\n\\n“While North Korea is eager to acquire military technology, the ultimate decision is not in their hands,” Mr. Xia stated, emphasizing that the alliance is precarious and likely unsustainable in the face of stringent international sanctions.\\n\\nIndependent analyst Zhuge Mingyang also weighed in.\\n\\n“In a relationship marked more by utilitarian needs than genuine alliance, both nations recognize the other’s motivations,” he told The Epoch Times.\\n\\n“Moscow likely knows full well that Pyongyang is siphoning off its military technology but seems willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for much-needed ammunition—a clear example of a ‘friendship’ based on mutual expediency.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits \\n\\n Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits\\n\\nIn surprisingly blunt words, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the coming year will essentially decide the fate of Ukraine and its war with Russia.\\n\\n\"A turning point in the war is approaching,\" Andrii Yermak, who serves as chief of staff for the Office of the President of Ukraine, said Monday. \"The next year will be decisive in this regard.\" He issued the words while appealing for more urgent aid from Washington in an address to the hawkish DC-based Hudson Institute think tank.\\n\\nYermak sought to assure the audience that Zelensky has \"a clear plan\" forward even as Western media has by and large soured on Kiev's prospects for success. Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.\\n\\nHe described advancing plans for \"the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.\"\\n\\nBut he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more \"weapons right now\"--describing that \"Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.\"\\n\\nWithout doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as \"the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.\"\\n\\nSo now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the \"bad news\" of late out of Ukraine.\\n\\nYermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be \"charity\" but is instead an \"investment\" in America's \"global leadership.\"\\n\\nHe further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. \"We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,\" Yermak said.\\n\\nWatch the full Hudson Institute speech below:</td>\n",

It was unclear whether they were talking about the same facility.\\n\\nAir defences destroyed 18 of 29 inbound missiles and 25 of 28 attack drones, the Ukranian air force said.\\n\\nThere were almost no details about what had been damaged, but the targeting of critical infrastructure could indicate that Russia is trying to keep up pressure on the energy system after its strikes caused widespread blackouts on March 22.\\n\\nThe energy ministry said that Ukraine, which has been exporting power in recent weeks, had sharply increased imports of electricity and stopped exports on March 24 after attacks on the energy system.\\n\\nSeveral explosions rang out in Kyiv in the early hours as air defences destroyed about a dozen missiles over the capital and in its vicinity, according to Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration.\\n\\nThere was only minor damage from the attack, he said.\\n\\nSmall groups of people huddled for safety underground in a central Kyiv metro station in the early hours, some of them sleeping on camping mats.\\n\\nMoscow has been pounding Ukraine for days in attacks portrayed by Moscow as revenge for Ukrainian attacks that were conducted during Russia’s presidential election.\\n\\nThe wreckage of a downed Kh-55 cruise missile was found in a Kyiv park, officials said.\\n\\n“For the third pre-dawn morning this week, all of Ukraine is under an air alert and has been advised to seek shelter,” U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink posted on social media platform X.\\n\\nPolish AirspacePoland’s armed forces said a Russian cruise missile launched at the region of Lviv had violated Poland’s airspace.\\n\\n“The object entered Polish space near the town of Oserdow [Lublin Voivodeship] and stayed there for 39 seconds,” it said on X. “During the entire flight, it was observed by military radar systems.”\\n\\nPoland’s army spokesperson, Jacek Goryszewski, told reporters that the missile travelled about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) into Polish airspace before returning to Ukraine.\\n\\nThere was no immediate comment from Russia. Warsaw said it would demand an explanation from Moscow.\\n\\nPolish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Warsaw would continue to support Ukraine both militarily and on the humanitarian side.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Strategy needed to preserve water resources in Pakistan \\n\\n ISLAMABAD-Pakistan needs to chalk out an effective and feasible plan to preserve its water resources and stop the depletion of underground water, WealthPK reported.\\n\\nAccording to an expert, water is one of the basic necessities of life and Pakistan is blessed with an abundance of water resources. However, the country’s water resources are depleting with the passage of time. It is feared that the entire world will face an acute water shortage in the coming years. Saiqa Imran, the deputy director of the Pakistan Council of Research and Water Reservoirs (PCRWR), told WealthPK that the country was feared to face an acute shortage of fresh water. “The quantity of fresh water is quite limited in the country,” she added. According to her, climate change is the primary cause of the depletion of water resources. She said that the shortage of water triggered concerns about the future availability of water for the world’s exponentially rising population.\\n\\nSaiqa Imran said that in most cases, the water table was constantly going down as a result of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. “With a growing world population, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the harder it becomes to get the amount of water we need because we pump the groundwater faster than it can be replenished,” she added. She said that inefficient water distribution and mismanagement were the main causes of the water shortage. “Pakistan has one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world where more than 93% of water is used by the agriculture sector, 5% by the domestic sector and 2% by the industrial sector,” said the expert.\\n\\nShe said that domestic and industrial sectors would use 15% more water by 2025 than their current consumption. She said that the agriculture sector was the biggest user of water as modern irrigation techniques were not adopted in Pakistan but its contribution to the national economy was declining with the passage of time. Saiqa Imran said that the world’s average storage capacity reached 40% but Pakistan could conserve only up to 10% of its annual river water due to insufficient space. “People have turned to use underground water as a result of the shortage of the most essential commodity. The indiscriminate over-pumping in the cities in the absence of regulatory bodies has also led to the depletion of groundwater,” she added.\\n\\nAccording to her, there is a dire need to devise a proper pricing mechanism for water usage in any sector. She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. “Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,” Saiqa Imran told WealthPK.</td>\n",

       "0  The World Needs Peacemaker Trump Again \\n\\n by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:\\n\\nThe world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.\\n\\nThese “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.\\n\\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\\n\\nThere has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”\\n\\nLast year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.\\n\\nChina is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.\\n\\nUkraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.\\n\\nOn October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.\\n\\nAs Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?\\n\\nTo further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.\\n\\nTo retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\\n\\nAs the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”\\n\\nIt is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”\\n\\nBiden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.\\n\\nNot content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.\\n\\nAs the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.\\n\\nRead More @ TheLibertyDaily.com   \n",

Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.\\n\\nThe study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.\\n\\nThe hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.\\n\\nSPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.\\n\\nExperts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits.

Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.\\n\\nHe described advancing plans for \"the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.\"\\n\\nBut he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more \"weapons right now\"--describing that \"Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.\"\\n\\nWithout doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as \"the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.\"\\n\\nSo now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the \"bad news\" of late out of Ukraine.\\n\\nYermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be \"charity\" but is instead an \"investment\" in America's \"global leadership.\"\\n\\nHe further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. \"We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,\" Yermak said.\\n\\nWatch the full Hudson Institute speech below:   \n",

However, the country’s water resources are depleting with the passage of time. It is feared that the entire world will face an acute water shortage in the coming years. Saiqa Imran, the deputy director of the Pakistan Council of Research and Water Reservoirs (PCRWR), told WealthPK that the country was feared to face an acute shortage of fresh water. “The quantity of fresh water is quite limited in the country,” she added. According to her, climate change is the primary cause of the depletion of water resources. She said that the shortage of water triggered concerns about the future availability of water for the world’s exponentially rising population.\\n\\nSaiqa Imran said that in most cases, the water table was constantly going down as a result of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. “With a growing world population, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the harder it becomes to get the amount of water we need because we pump the groundwater faster than it can be replenished,” she added. She said that inefficient water distribution and mismanagement were the main causes of the water shortage. “Pakistan has one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world where more than 93% of water is used by the agriculture sector, 5% by the domestic sector and 2% by the industrial sector,” said the expert.\\n\\nShe said that domestic and industrial sectors would use 15% more water by 2025 than their current consumption. She said that the agriculture sector was the biggest user of water as modern irrigation techniques were not adopted in Pakistan but its contribution to the national economy was declining with the passage of time. Saiqa Imran said that the world’s average storage capacity reached 40% but Pakistan could conserve only up to 10% of its annual river water due to insufficient space. “People have turned to use underground water as a result of the shortage of the most essential commodity. The indiscriminate over-pumping in the cities in the absence of regulatory bodies has also led to the depletion of groundwater,” she added.\\n\\nAccording to her, there is a dire need to devise a proper pricing mechanism for water usage in any sector. She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. “Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,” Saiqa Imran told WealthPK.   \n",

       "      <td>The World Needs Peacemaker Trump Again \\n\\n by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:\\n\\nThe world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.\\n\\nThese “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.\\n\\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\\n\\nThere has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”\\n\\nLast year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.\\n\\nChina is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.\\n\\nUkraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.\\n\\nOn October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.\\n\\nAs Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?\\n\\nTo further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.\\n\\nTo retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\\n\\nAs the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”\\n\\nIt is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”\\n\\nBiden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.\\n\\nNot content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.\\n\\nAs the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.\\n\\nRead More @ TheLibertyDaily.com</td>\n",

       "      <td>Desperation and Diplomacy: North Korea's Tech Hunt in Russia Amid Sanctions \\n\\n For several decades, North Korea has masterfully balanced its relations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia, maintaining a relationship with the latter that is both complex and ever-changing.\\n\\nThe dynamics have shifted notably since Russia found itself sanctioned and isolated by the international community following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\\n\\nSince then, North Korea and Russia have grown increasingly close, as recently seen when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited eastern Russia, where he held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.\\n\\nAfter a six-day visit, Mr. Kim returned to Pyongyang on Sunday.\\n\\nSanctioned by the international community, North Korea desperately needs Russian technology for nuclear weapons, satellite development, and food production.\\n\\nSimilarly, Russia, also facing sanctions, urgently seeks to replenish its dwindling front-line supplies with large quantities of ammunition from North Korea.\\n\\nBefore the summit, when asked whether Russia would assist North Korea in developing artificial satellites, Mr. Putin confirmed this was a primary reason for their meeting.\\n\\nBoth sides appear willing to overlook the threat of escalated international sanctions against them.\\n\\nDuring their summit, Mr. Kim vowed to “fully and unconditionally support” Moscow.\\n\\nRocket technology holds particular interest for Mr. Kim and his regime.\\n\\nFrom Outward Support to Clandestine CyberattacksAccording to reports, North Korea has long eyed Russian technology, resorting to cyber theft to obtain it, and it is something that Moscow now appears ready to overlook despite recent reports such as one by Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC).\\n\\nThe MTAC report indicates that between March last year and this March, North Korean cyber operatives launched attacks on Russian aerospace research facilities and penetrated academic institutions engaged in research. Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.\\n\\nThe study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.\\n\\nThe hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.\\n\\nSPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.\\n\\nExperts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits. These cyber activities appear crucial in advancing the country’s space technology.\\n\\nAdditionally, the report disclosed that in 2020, North Korean hackers penetrated the internal network of Russia’s Almaz-Antey, a leading manufacturer of surface-to-air missiles. The intruders pilfered various information, including developer personal data and proprietary details on missile components.\\n\\nIn 2019, North Korean cyber operatives also exfiltrated design blueprints from Russia’s Uralvagonzavod tank factory, the entity responsible for producing Russia’s next-generation T-14 Armata battle tank.\\n\\nMoreover, the report highlighted the frequency of North Korean cyber-attacks against Russian defense corporations specializing in avant-garde weapon systems like hypersonic technologies and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).\\n\\nMilitary commentator Xia Loshan told The Epoch Times on Sept. 10 that both North Korea and Russia are in a desperate situation.\\n\\n“While North Korea is eager to acquire military technology, the ultimate decision is not in their hands,” Mr. Xia stated, emphasizing that the alliance is precarious and likely unsustainable in the face of stringent international sanctions.\\n\\nIndependent analyst Zhuge Mingyang also weighed in.\\n\\n“In a relationship marked more by utilitarian needs than genuine alliance, both nations recognize the other’s motivations,” he told The Epoch Times.\\n\\n“Moscow likely knows full well that Pyongyang is siphoning off its military technology but seems willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for much-needed ammunition—a clear example of a ‘friendship’ based on mutual expediency.”</td>\n",

Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.\\n\\nHe described advancing plans for \"the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.\"\\n\\nBut he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more \"weapons right now\"--describing that \"Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.\"\\n\\nWithout doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as \"the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.\"\\n\\nSo now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the \"bad news\" of late out of Ukraine.\\n\\nYermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be \"charity\" but is instead an \"investment\" in America's \"global leadership.\"\\n\\nHe further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. \"We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,\" Yermak said.\\n\\nWatch the full Hudson Institute speech below:</td>\n",

It was unclear whether they were talking about the same facility.\\n\\nAir defences destroyed 18 of 29 inbound missiles and 25 of 28 attack drones, the Ukranian air force said.\\n\\nThere were almost no details about what had been damaged, but the targeting of critical infrastructure could indicate that Russia is trying to keep up pressure on the energy system after its strikes caused widespread blackouts on March 22.\\n\\nThe energy ministry said that Ukraine, which has been exporting power in recent weeks, had sharply increased imports of electricity and stopped exports on March 24 after attacks on the energy system.\\n\\nSeveral explosions rang out in Kyiv in the early hours as air defences destroyed about a dozen missiles over the capital and in its vicinity, according to Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration.\\n\\nThere was only minor damage from the attack, he said.\\n\\nSmall groups of people huddled for safety underground in a central Kyiv metro station in the early hours, some of them sleeping on camping mats.\\n\\nMoscow has been pounding Ukraine for days in attacks portrayed by Moscow as revenge for Ukrainian attacks that were conducted during Russia’s presidential election.\\n\\nThe wreckage of a downed Kh-55 cruise missile was found in a Kyiv park, officials said.\\n\\n“For the third pre-dawn morning this week, all of Ukraine is under an air alert and has been advised to seek shelter,” U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink posted on social media platform X.\\n\\nPolish AirspacePoland’s armed forces said a Russian cruise missile launched at the region of Lviv had violated Poland’s airspace.\\n\\n“The object entered Polish space near the town of Oserdow [Lublin Voivodeship] and stayed there for 39 seconds,” it said on X. “During the entire flight, it was observed by military radar systems.”\\n\\nPoland’s army spokesperson, Jacek Goryszewski, told reporters that the missile travelled about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) into Polish airspace before returning to Ukraine.\\n\\nThere was no immediate comment from Russia. Warsaw said it would demand an explanation from Moscow.\\n\\nPolish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said Warsaw would continue to support Ukraine both militarily and on the humanitarian side.</td>\n",

She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. “Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,” Saiqa Imran told WealthPK.</td>\n",

       "0  The World Needs Peacemaker Trump Again \\n\\n by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:\\n\\nThe world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.\\n\\nThese “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.\\n\\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\\n\\nThere has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”\\n\\nLast year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.\\n\\nChina is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.\\n\\nUkraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.\\n\\nOn October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.\\n\\nAs Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?\\n\\nTo further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.\\n\\nTo retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\\n\\nAs the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”\\n\\nIt is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”\\n\\nBiden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.\\n\\nNot content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.\\n\\nAs the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.\\n\\nRead More @ TheLibertyDaily.com   \n",

Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.\\n\\nThe study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.\\n\\nThe hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.\\n\\nSPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.\\n\\nExperts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits.

Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.\\n\\nHe described advancing plans for \"the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.\"\\n\\nBut he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more \"weapons right now\"--describing that \"Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.\"\\n\\nWithout doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as \"the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.\"\\n\\nSo now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the \"bad news\" of late out of Ukraine.\\n\\nYermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be \"charity\" but is instead an \"investment\" in America's \"global leadership.\"\\n\\nHe further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. \"We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,\" Yermak said.\\n\\nWatch the full Hudson Institute speech below:   \n",

However, the country’s water resources are depleting with the passage of time. It is feared that the entire world will face an acute water shortage in the coming years. Saiqa Imran, the deputy director of the Pakistan Council of Research and Water Reservoirs (PCRWR), told WealthPK that the country was feared to face an acute shortage of fresh water. “The quantity of fresh water is quite limited in the country,” she added. According to her, climate change is the primary cause of the depletion of water resources. She said that the shortage of water triggered concerns about the future availability of water for the world’s exponentially rising population.\\n\\nSaiqa Imran said that in most cases, the water table was constantly going down as a result of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. “With a growing world population, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the harder it becomes to get the amount of water we need because we pump the groundwater faster than it can be replenished,” she added. She said that inefficient water distribution and mismanagement were the main causes of the water shortage. “Pakistan has one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world where more than 93% of water is used by the agriculture sector, 5% by the domestic sector and 2% by the industrial sector,” said the expert.\\n\\nShe said that domestic and industrial sectors would use 15% more water by 2025 than their current consumption. She said that the agriculture sector was the biggest user of water as modern irrigation techniques were not adopted in Pakistan but its contribution to the national economy was declining with the passage of time. Saiqa Imran said that the world’s average storage capacity reached 40% but Pakistan could conserve only up to 10% of its annual river water due to insufficient space. “People have turned to use underground water as a result of the shortage of the most essential commodity. The indiscriminate over-pumping in the cities in the absence of regulatory bodies has also led to the depletion of groundwater,” she added.\\n\\nAccording to her, there is a dire need to devise a proper pricing mechanism for water usage in any sector. She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. “Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,” Saiqa Imran told WealthPK.   \n",

      "143  ‘This Is A F**king War’: Jamie Dimon Slams Biden For Begging Saudis For Oil \\n\\n Three days after Jamie Dimon sparked a marketwide selloff that sent stocks to fresh 2022 lows after he predicted a US recession in “6 to 9” months citing drivers including rising interest rates, persistent inflation, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and warned stocks could drop another 20%, the JPMorgan CEO who is expected to report earnings tomorrow (and hopefully clarify why his bank refuses to move its deposit rate above 0.01% in the process keeping $2.2 trillion in liquidity locked inside the overnight funding facility), doubled down today saying the Fed can’t cool the red-hot economy without bringing on a recession. [bold, links added]\\n\\n…snip… In separate – and far more provocative -comments made earlier in the day during a JPMorgan investor seminar where he led a fireside chat moderated by JPMorgan’s Gergana Thiel, Dimon made some extremely outspoken comments that you won’t hear on the mainstream media, telling a small group of listeners that was closed to the press that the “President of the United States needs to stand up and say we may not meet our 2050 climate objectives because this is a fucking war.”\\n\\nHe also said, “time to stop going hat in hand to Venezuela and Saudi and start pumping more oil & gas in the USA.”\\n\\nEchoing what he has said before, Jamie said this is the way the USA maintains its standing, as the future of the world is by pumping more oil and gas and using energy security to ensure Western unity.\\n\\nAnd he did say when it comes to ESG that “investors don’t give a shit” warning not to “cede governance to do-gooder kids on a committee.”\\n\\nFinally, he stressed the need for strong American leadership that is not being provided by either party. His conclusion: the world needs American diplomacy and neither Trump nor Biden can lead the USA.\\n\\nh/t Rúnar O.\\n\\nRead rest at ZeroHedge\\n\\nJoin our list\\n\\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.\\n\\nFundamentally, Mr. Dimon is right. Fossil fuels provide 80% of our domestic primary energy with an ongoing evolution that has taken about 120 years to build our modern, reliable & affordable domestic energy system. The “energy transition” will not be accelerated by government mandate or fiat. It will be dictated by the laws of physics and the energy imperatives of cost, energy/power density, scale & sustainability. So, Joe Biden can madate we will “openly defy gravity by 2050.” That does not mean we can IMPLEMENT it! We’d better get a fully informed, rational and civilzed debate on energy & attendant environmental policy started soon. Otherwise, the average Americans standard of living will continue to head south. Just ask anyone in the EU how the “Green Dream” is working out. With the current policy course, the U.S is only 2-3 years behind the same DISASTOROUS result…\\n\\nJamie Dimon speaks the truth and the Democrats don’t like that. Lower energy costs would lower inflation, but that would require new refineries and some backing from Washington that gives the explorers and drillers confidence. ESG is a money loser. Avoid any entity that promotes it.\\n\\nWe wouldn’t have to pay higher prices to gas up our cars and lawnmowers if Biden the Bumbler Had’d canceled the Keystone Pipeline and the ANWR to appease the Eco-Freaks and the Russians/OPEC   \n",

       "      <td>The World Needs Peacemaker Trump Again \\n\\n by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:\\n\\nThe world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.\\n\\nThese “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.\\n\\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\\n\\nThere has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”\\n\\nLast year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.\\n\\nChina is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.\\n\\nUkraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.\\n\\nOn October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.\\n\\nAs Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?\\n\\nTo further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.\\n\\nTo retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\\n\\nAs the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”\\n\\nIt is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”\\n\\nBiden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.\\n\\nNot content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.\\n\\nAs the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.\\n\\nRead More @ TheLibertyDaily.com</td>\n",

       "      <td>Desperation and Diplomacy: North Korea's Tech Hunt in Russia Amid Sanctions \\n\\n For several decades, North Korea has masterfully balanced its relations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia, maintaining a relationship with the latter that is both complex and ever-changing.\\n\\nThe dynamics have shifted notably since Russia found itself sanctioned and isolated by the international community following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\\n\\nSince then, North Korea and Russia have grown increasingly close, as recently seen when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited eastern Russia, where he held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.\\n\\nAfter a six-day visit, Mr. Kim returned to Pyongyang on Sunday.\\n\\nSanctioned by the international community, North Korea desperately needs Russian technology for nuclear weapons, satellite development, and food production.\\n\\nSimilarly, Russia, also facing sanctions, urgently seeks to replenish its dwindling front-line supplies with large quantities of ammunition from North Korea.\\n\\nBefore the summit, when asked whether Russia would assist North Korea in developing artificial satellites, Mr. Putin confirmed this was a primary reason for their meeting.\\n\\nBoth sides appear willing to overlook the threat of escalated international sanctions against them.\\n\\nDuring their summit, Mr. Kim vowed to “fully and unconditionally support” Moscow.\\n\\nRocket technology holds particular interest for Mr. Kim and his regime.\\n\\nFrom Outward Support to Clandestine CyberattacksAccording to reports, North Korea has long eyed Russian technology, resorting to cyber theft to obtain it, and it is something that Moscow now appears ready to overlook despite recent reports such as one by Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC).\\n\\nThe MTAC report indicates that between March last year and this March, North Korean cyber operatives launched attacks on Russian aerospace research facilities and penetrated academic institutions engaged in research. Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.\\n\\nThe study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.\\n\\nThe hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.\\n\\nSPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.\\n\\nExperts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits. These cyber activities appear crucial in advancing the country’s space technology.\\n\\nAdditionally, the report disclosed that in 2020, North Korean hackers penetrated the internal network of Russia’s Almaz-Antey, a leading manufacturer of surface-to-air missiles. The intruders pilfered various information, including developer personal data and proprietary details on missile components.\\n\\nIn 2019, North Korean cyber operatives also exfiltrated design blueprints from Russia’s Uralvagonzavod tank factory, the entity responsible for producing Russia’s next-generation T-14 Armata battle tank.\\n\\nMoreover, the report highlighted the frequency of North Korean cyber-attacks against Russian defense corporations specializing in avant-garde weapon systems like hypersonic technologies and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).\\n\\nMilitary commentator Xia Loshan told The Epoch Times on Sept. 10 that both North Korea and Russia are in a desperate situation.\\n\\n“While North Korea is eager to acquire military technology, the ultimate decision is not in their hands,” Mr. Xia stated, emphasizing that the alliance is precarious and likely unsustainable in the face of stringent international sanctions.\\n\\nIndependent analyst Zhuge Mingyang also weighed in.\\n\\n“In a relationship marked more by utilitarian needs than genuine alliance, both nations recognize the other’s motivations,” he told The Epoch Times.\\n\\n“Moscow likely knows full well that Pyongyang is siphoning off its military technology but seems willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for much-needed ammunition—a clear example of a ‘friendship’ based on mutual expediency.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits \\n\\n Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits\\n\\nIn surprisingly blunt words, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the coming year will essentially decide the fate of Ukraine and its war with Russia.\\n\\n\"A turning point in the war is approaching,\" Andrii Yermak, who serves as chief of staff for the Office of the President of Ukraine, said Monday. \"The next year will be decisive in this regard.\" He issued the words while appealing for more urgent aid from Washington in an address to the hawkish DC-based Hudson Institute think tank.\\n\\nYermak sought to assure the audience that Zelensky has \"a clear plan\" forward even as Western media has by and large soured on Kiev's prospects for success. Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.\\n\\nHe described advancing plans for \"the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.\"\\n\\nBut he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more \"weapons right now\"--describing that \"Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.\"\\n\\nWithout doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as \"the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.\"\\n\\nSo now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the \"bad news\" of late out of Ukraine.\\n\\nYermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be \"charity\" but is instead an \"investment\" in America's \"global leadership.\"\\n\\nHe further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. \"We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,\" Yermak said.\\n\\nWatch the full Hudson Institute speech below:</td>\n",

       "      <td>Strategy needed to preserve water resources in Pakistan \\n\\n ISLAMABAD-Pakistan needs to chalk out an effective and feasible plan to preserve its water resources and stop the depletion of underground water, WealthPK reported.\\n\\nAccording to an expert, water is one of the basic necessities of life and Pakistan is blessed with an abundance of water resources. However, the country’s water resources are depleting with the passage of time. It is feared that the entire world will face an acute water shortage in the coming years. Saiqa Imran, the deputy director of the Pakistan Council of Research and Water Reservoirs (PCRWR), told WealthPK that the country was feared to face an acute shortage of fresh water. “The quantity of fresh water is quite limited in the country,” she added. According to her, climate change is the primary cause of the depletion of water resources. She said that the shortage of water triggered concerns about the future availability of water for the world’s exponentially rising population.\\n\\nSaiqa Imran said that in most cases, the water table was constantly going down as a result of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. “With a growing world population, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the harder it becomes to get the amount of water we need because we pump the groundwater faster than it can be replenished,” she added. She said that inefficient water distribution and mismanagement were the main causes of the water shortage. “Pakistan has one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world where more than 93% of water is used by the agriculture sector, 5% by the domestic sector and 2% by the industrial sector,” said the expert.\\n\\nShe said that domestic and industrial sectors would use 15% more water by 2025 than their current consumption. She said that the agriculture sector was the biggest user of water as modern irrigation techniques were not adopted in Pakistan but its contribution to the national economy was declining with the passage of time. Saiqa Imran said that the world’s average storage capacity reached 40% but Pakistan could conserve only up to 10% of its annual river water due to insufficient space. “People have turned to use underground water as a result of the shortage of the most essential commodity. The indiscriminate over-pumping in the cities in the absence of regulatory bodies has also led to the depletion of groundwater,” she added.\\n\\nAccording to her, there is a dire need to devise a proper pricing mechanism for water usage in any sector. She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. “Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,” Saiqa Imran told WealthPK.</td>\n",

       "0  The World Needs Peacemaker Trump Again \\n\\n by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:\\n\\nThe world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.\\n\\nThese “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.\\n\\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\\n\\nThere has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”\\n\\nLast year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.\\n\\nChina is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.\\n\\nUkraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.\\n\\nOn October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.\\n\\nAs Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?\\n\\nTo further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.\\n\\nTo retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\\n\\nAs the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”\\n\\nIt is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”\\n\\nBiden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.\\n\\nNot content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.\\n\\nAs the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.\\n\\nRead More @ TheLibertyDaily.com   \n",

Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.\\n\\nThe study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.\\n\\nThe hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.\\n\\nSPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.\\n\\nExperts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits.

Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.\\n\\nHe described advancing plans for \"the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.\"\\n\\nBut he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more \"weapons right now\"--describing that \"Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.\"\\n\\nWithout doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as \"the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.\"\\n\\nSo now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the \"bad news\" of late out of Ukraine.\\n\\nYermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be \"charity\" but is instead an \"investment\" in America's \"global leadership.\"\\n\\nHe further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. \"We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,\" Yermak said.\\n\\nWatch the full Hudson Institute speech below:   \n",

However, the country’s water resources are depleting with the passage of time. It is feared that the entire world will face an acute water shortage in the coming years. Saiqa Imran, the deputy director of the Pakistan Council of Research and Water Reservoirs (PCRWR), told WealthPK that the country was feared to face an acute shortage of fresh water. “The quantity of fresh water is quite limited in the country,” she added. According to her, climate change is the primary cause of the depletion of water resources. She said that the shortage of water triggered concerns about the future availability of water for the world’s exponentially rising population.\\n\\nSaiqa Imran said that in most cases, the water table was constantly going down as a result of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. “With a growing world population, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the harder it becomes to get the amount of water we need because we pump the groundwater faster than it can be replenished,” she added. She said that inefficient water distribution and mismanagement were the main causes of the water shortage. “Pakistan has one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world where more than 93% of water is used by the agriculture sector, 5% by the domestic sector and 2% by the industrial sector,” said the expert.\\n\\nShe said that domestic and industrial sectors would use 15% more water by 2025 than their current consumption. She said that the agriculture sector was the biggest user of water as modern irrigation techniques were not adopted in Pakistan but its contribution to the national economy was declining with the passage of time. Saiqa Imran said that the world’s average storage capacity reached 40% but Pakistan could conserve only up to 10% of its annual river water due to insufficient space. “People have turned to use underground water as a result of the shortage of the most essential commodity. The indiscriminate over-pumping in the cities in the absence of regulatory bodies has also led to the depletion of groundwater,” she added.\\n\\nAccording to her, there is a dire need to devise a proper pricing mechanism for water usage in any sector. She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. “Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,” Saiqa Imran told WealthPK.   \n",
