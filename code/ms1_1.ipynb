Watch:\\n\\nEarlier this year, Gates flew around Australia on board his $70 million dollar luxury private jet lecturing people about climate change and ordering them to stop flying on planes.\\n\\nGates, who has declared that the energy crisis is a good thing, owns no fewer than FOUR private jets at a combined cost of $194 million dollars.\\n\\nA study carried out by Linnaeus University economics professor Stefan Gössling found that Gates flew more than 213,000 miles on 59 private jet flights in 2017 alone.\\n\\nGates emitted an estimated 1,760 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, over a hundred times more than the emissions per capita in the United States, according to data from the World Bank.\\n\\nElsewhere during the carefully constructed interview, Gates said he was surprised that he was targeted by ‘conspiracy theorists’ for pushing vaccines during the pandemic.\\n\\nWhile the BBC interview was set up to look like Gates was being challenged or grilled, he wasn’t asked about his close friendship with the elite pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.   \n",

The demonstrators responded by throwing snow and ice at them and forced them to retreat.\\n\\nIt is reported that negotiations are underway between the protesters and special forces: the law… pic.twitter.com/AVHf2gBi7w\\n\\nAlsynov’s conviction for inciting ethnic hatred sparked rare large-scale protests in Russia, where the risk of arrest typically stifles such demonstrations. Reports suggest thousands participated in the multi-day protest in -20°C temperatures, resulting in several injuries. \\n\\nThe activist denies the charges related to insulting migrants during a demonstration against gold mining plans. Supporters claim the case is retaliation for Alsynov’s activism against soda mining in a culturally significant area. He allegedly referred to Central Asians and Caucasians, comprising a significant portion of Russia’s migrant population, as “black people” in the Bashkir language. \\n\\nAlsynov contends the Bashkir words meant “poor people” and were mistranslated into Russian. He plans to appeal the verdict. Alsynov has previously criticized military mobilization in the region as “genocide” against the Bashkir people. Ongoing concerns exist about the disproportionate deployment of ethnic minorities, including Bashkirs, in conflicts such as Ukraine. \\n\\nAlsynov was a leader of Bashkort, a grassroots movement focused on preserving Bashkir ethnic identity, which was banned as extremist in 2020.

By subscribing you agree to our Terms of Use\\n\\n“Should I stay at home and not come to Kenya and learn about farming and malaria?” Gates said in the interview with Amol Rajan.\\n\\n“I’m comfortable with the idea that not only am I not part of the problem by paying for the offsets, but also through the billions that my Breakthrough Energy Group is spending, that I’m part of the solution,” Gates added. Watch:\\n\\nEarlier this year, Gates flew around Australia on board his $70 million dollar luxury private jet lecturing people about climate change and ordering them to stop flying on planes.\\n\\nGates, who has declared that the energy crisis is a good thing, owns no fewer than FOUR private jets at a combined cost of $194 million dollars.\\n\\nA study carried out by Linnaeus University economics professor Stefan Gössling found that Gates flew more than 213,000 miles on 59 private jet flights in 2017 alone.\\n\\nGates emitted an estimated 1,760 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, over a hundred times more than the emissions per capita in the United States, according to data from the World Bank.\\n\\nElsewhere during the carefully constructed interview, Gates said he was surprised that he was targeted by ‘conspiracy theorists’ for pushing vaccines during the pandemic.\\n\\nWhile the BBC interview was set up to look like Gates was being challenged or grilled, he wasn’t asked about his close friendship with the elite pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</td>\n",

Social media footage captured the confrontations near the court in Baymak, with supporters engaging in clashes with police, including throwing snowballs.\\n\\nViolent clashes in Baymak— NEXTA (@nexta_tv) January 17, 2024\\n\\nLaw enforcers used stun grenades in Baymak, Bashkortostan, Russia.

Reports suggest thousands participated in the multi-day protest in -20°C temperatures, resulting in several injuries. \\n\\nThe activist denies the charges related to insulting migrants during a demonstration against gold mining plans. Supporters claim the case is retaliation for Alsynov’s activism against soda mining in a culturally significant area. He allegedly referred to Central Asians and Caucasians, comprising a significant portion of Russia’s migrant population, as “black people” in the Bashkir language. \\n\\nAlsynov contends the Bashkir words meant “poor people” and were mistranslated into Russian. He plans to appeal the verdict. Alsynov has previously criticized military mobilization in the region as “genocide” against the Bashkir people. Ongoing concerns exist about the disproportionate deployment of ethnic minorities, including Bashkirs, in conflicts such as Ukraine. \\n\\nAlsynov was a leader of Bashkort, a grassroots movement focused on preserving Bashkir ethnic identity, which was banned as extremist in 2020. The clashes signify a rare instance of public dissent in Russia, underscoring the intensity of emotions surrounding Alsynov’s case and broader issues of ethnic identity and activism in the country.</td>\n",

Watch:\\n\\nEarlier this year, Gates flew around Australia on board his $70 million dollar luxury private jet lecturing people about climate change and ordering them to stop flying on planes.\\n\\nGates, who has declared that the energy crisis is a good thing, owns no fewer than FOUR private jets at a combined cost of $194 million dollars.\\n\\nA study carried out by Linnaeus University economics professor Stefan Gössling found that Gates flew more than 213,000 miles on 59 private jet flights in 2017 alone.\\n\\nGates emitted an estimated 1,760 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, over a hundred times more than the emissions per capita in the United States, according to data from the World Bank.\\n\\nElsewhere during the carefully constructed interview, Gates said he was surprised that he was targeted by ‘conspiracy theorists’ for pushing vaccines during the pandemic.\\n\\nWhile the BBC interview was set up to look like Gates was being challenged or grilled, he wasn’t asked about his close friendship with the elite pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.   \n",

The demonstrators responded by throwing snow and ice at them and forced them to retreat.\\n\\nIt is reported that negotiations are underway between the protesters and special forces: the law… pic.twitter.com/AVHf2gBi7w\\n\\nAlsynov’s conviction for inciting ethnic hatred sparked rare large-scale protests in Russia, where the risk of arrest typically stifles such demonstrations. Reports suggest thousands participated in the multi-day protest in -20°C temperatures, resulting in several injuries. \\n\\nThe activist denies the charges related to insulting migrants during a demonstration against gold mining plans. Supporters claim the case is retaliation for Alsynov’s activism against soda mining in a culturally significant area. He allegedly referred to Central Asians and Caucasians, comprising a significant portion of Russia’s migrant population, as “black people” in the Bashkir language. \\n\\nAlsynov contends the Bashkir words meant “poor people” and were mistranslated into Russian. He plans to appeal the verdict. Alsynov has previously criticized military mobilization in the region as “genocide” against the Bashkir people. Ongoing concerns exist about the disproportionate deployment of ethnic minorities, including Bashkirs, in conflicts such as Ukraine. \\n\\nAlsynov was a leader of Bashkort, a grassroots movement focused on preserving Bashkir ethnic identity, which was banned as extremist in 2020.

Watch:\\n\\nEarlier this year, Gates flew around Australia on board his $70 million dollar luxury private jet lecturing people about climate change and ordering them to stop flying on planes.\\n\\nGates, who has declared that the energy crisis is a good thing, owns no fewer than FOUR private jets at a combined cost of $194 million dollars.\\n\\nA study carried out by Linnaeus University economics professor Stefan Gössling found that Gates flew more than 213,000 miles on 59 private jet flights in 2017 alone.\\n\\nGates emitted an estimated 1,760 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, over a hundred times more than the emissions per capita in the United States, according to data from the World Bank.\\n\\nElsewhere during the carefully constructed interview, Gates said he was surprised that he was targeted by ‘conspiracy theorists’ for pushing vaccines during the pandemic.\\n\\nWhile the BBC interview was set up to look like Gates was being challenged or grilled, he wasn’t asked about his close friendship with the elite pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</td>\n",

Reports suggest thousands participated in the multi-day protest in -20°C temperatures, resulting in several injuries. \\n\\nThe activist denies the charges related to insulting migrants during a demonstration against gold mining plans. Supporters claim the case is retaliation for Alsynov’s activism against soda mining in a culturally significant area. He allegedly referred to Central Asians and Caucasians, comprising a significant portion of Russia’s migrant population, as “black people” in the Bashkir language. \\n\\nAlsynov contends the Bashkir words meant “poor people” and were mistranslated into Russian. He plans to appeal the verdict. Alsynov has previously criticized military mobilization in the region as “genocide” against the Bashkir people. Ongoing concerns exist about the disproportionate deployment of ethnic minorities, including Bashkirs, in conflicts such as Ukraine. \\n\\nAlsynov was a leader of Bashkort, a grassroots movement focused on preserving Bashkir ethnic identity, which was banned as extremist in 2020. The clashes signify a rare instance of public dissent in Russia, underscoring the intensity of emotions surrounding Alsynov’s case and broader issues of ethnic identity and activism in the country.</td>\n",

Watch:\\n\\nEarlier this year, Gates flew around Australia on board his $70 million dollar luxury private jet lecturing people about climate change and ordering them to stop flying on planes.\\n\\nGates, who has declared that the energy crisis is a good thing, owns no fewer than FOUR private jets at a combined cost of $194 million dollars.\\n\\nA study carried out by Linnaeus University economics professor Stefan Gössling found that Gates flew more than 213,000 miles on 59 private jet flights in 2017 alone.\\n\\nGates emitted an estimated 1,760 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, over a hundred times more than the emissions per capita in the United States, according to data from the World Bank.\\n\\nElsewhere during the carefully constructed interview, Gates said he was surprised that he was targeted by ‘conspiracy theorists’ for pushing vaccines during the pandemic.\\n\\nWhile the BBC interview was set up to look like Gates was being challenged or grilled, he wasn’t asked about his close friendship with the elite pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.   \n",

Reports suggest thousands participated in the multi-day protest in -20°C temperatures, resulting in several injuries. \\n\\nThe activist denies the charges related to insulting migrants during a demonstration against gold mining plans. Supporters claim the case is retaliation for Alsynov’s activism against soda mining in a culturally significant area. He allegedly referred to Central Asians and Caucasians, comprising a significant portion of Russia’s migrant population, as “black people” in the Bashkir language. \\n\\nAlsynov contends the Bashkir words meant “poor people” and were mistranslated into Russian. He plans to appeal the verdict. Alsynov has previously criticized military mobilization in the region as “genocide” against the Bashkir people. Ongoing concerns exist about the disproportionate deployment of ethnic minorities, including Bashkirs, in conflicts such as Ukraine. \\n\\nAlsynov was a leader of Bashkort, a grassroots movement focused on preserving Bashkir ethnic identity, which was banned as extremist in 2020. The clashes signify a rare instance of public dissent in Russia, underscoring the intensity of emotions surrounding Alsynov’s case and broader issues of ethnic identity and activism in the country.   \n",

Watch:\\n\\nEarlier this year, Gates flew around Australia on board his $70 million dollar luxury private jet lecturing people about climate change and ordering them to stop flying on planes.\\n\\nGates, who has declared that the energy crisis is a good thing, owns no fewer than FOUR private jets at a combined cost of $194 million dollars.\\n\\nA study carried out by Linnaeus University economics professor Stefan Gössling found that Gates flew more than 213,000 miles on 59 private jet flights in 2017 alone.\\n\\nGates emitted an estimated 1,760 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, over a hundred times more than the emissions per capita in the United States, according to data from the World Bank.\\n\\nElsewhere during the carefully constructed interview, Gates said he was surprised that he was targeted by ‘conspiracy theorists’ for pushing vaccines during the pandemic.\\n\\nWhile the BBC interview was set up to look like Gates was being challenged or grilled, he wasn’t asked about his close friendship with the elite pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</td>\n",

Reports suggest thousands participated in the multi-day protest in -20°C temperatures, resulting in several injuries. \\n\\nThe activist denies the charges related to insulting migrants during a demonstration against gold mining plans. Supporters claim the case is retaliation for Alsynov’s activism against soda mining in a culturally significant area. He allegedly referred to Central Asians and Caucasians, comprising a significant portion of Russia’s migrant population, as “black people” in the Bashkir language. \\n\\nAlsynov contends the Bashkir words meant “poor people” and were mistranslated into Russian. He plans to appeal the verdict. Alsynov has previously criticized military mobilization in the region as “genocide” against the Bashkir people. Ongoing concerns exist about the disproportionate deployment of ethnic minorities, including Bashkirs, in conflicts such as Ukraine. \\n\\nAlsynov was a leader of Bashkort, a grassroots movement focused on preserving Bashkir ethnic identity, which was banned as extremist in 2020. The clashes signify a rare instance of public dissent in Russia, underscoring the intensity of emotions surrounding Alsynov’s case and broader issues of ethnic identity and activism in the country.</td>\n",

      "337  ‘This Is A F**king War’: Jamie Dimon Slams Biden For Begging Saudis For Oil \\n\\n Three days after Jamie Dimon sparked a marketwide selloff that sent stocks to fresh 2022 lows after he predicted a US recession in “6 to 9” months citing drivers including rising interest rates, persistent inflation, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and warned stocks could drop another 20%, the JPMorgan CEO who is expected to report earnings tomorrow (and hopefully clarify why his bank refuses to move its deposit rate above 0.01% in the process keeping $2.2 trillion in liquidity locked inside the overnight funding facility), doubled down today saying the Fed can’t cool the red-hot economy without bringing on a recession. [bold, links added]\\n\\n…snip… In separate – and far more provocative -comments made earlier in the day during a JPMorgan investor seminar where he led a fireside chat moderated by JPMorgan’s Gergana Thiel, Dimon made some extremely outspoken comments that you won’t hear on the mainstream media, telling a small group of listeners that was closed to the press that the “President of the United States needs to stand up and say we may not meet our 2050 climate objectives because this is a fucking war.”\\n\\nHe also said, “time to stop going hat in hand to Venezuela and Saudi and start pumping more oil & gas in the USA.”\\n\\nEchoing what he has said before, Jamie said this is the way the USA maintains its standing, as the future of the world is by pumping more oil and gas and using energy security to ensure Western unity.\\n\\nAnd he did say when it comes to ESG that “investors don’t give a shit” warning not to “cede governance to do-gooder kids on a committee.”\\n\\nFinally, he stressed the need for strong American leadership that is not being provided by either party. His conclusion: the world needs American diplomacy and neither Trump nor Biden can lead the USA.\\n\\nh/t Rúnar O.\\n\\nRead rest at ZeroHedge\\n\\nJoin our list\\n\\nSubscribe to our mailing list and get interesting stuff and updates to your email inbox.\\n\\nFundamentally, Mr. Dimon is right. Fossil fuels provide 80% of our domestic primary energy with an ongoing evolution that has taken about 120 years to build our modern, reliable & affordable domestic energy system. The “energy transition” will not be accelerated by government mandate or fiat. It will be dictated by the laws of physics and the energy imperatives of cost, energy/power density, scale & sustainability. So, Joe Biden can madate we will “openly defy gravity by 2050.” That does not mean we can IMPLEMENT it! We’d better get a fully informed, rational and civilzed debate on energy & attendant environmental policy started soon. Otherwise, the average Americans standard of living will continue to head south. Just ask anyone in the EU how the “Green Dream” is working out. With the current policy course, the U.S is only 2-3 years behind the same DISASTOROUS result…\\n\\nJamie Dimon speaks the truth and the Democrats don’t like that. Lower energy costs would lower inflation, but that would require new refineries and some backing from Washington that gives the explorers and drillers confidence. ESG is a money loser. Avoid any entity that promotes it.\\n\\nWe wouldn’t have to pay higher prices to gas up our cars and lawnmowers if Biden the Bumbler Had’d canceled the Keystone Pipeline and the ANWR to appease the Eco-Freaks and the Russians/OPEC   \n",

С упоритост, достойна за по-добро приложение, те говорят за „предимствата“ от прекъсването на енергийните връзки между Русия и Европа. Като „манна небесна“ служат рекордните доставки на американския втечнен газ, предназначени да заменят „недемократичния“ местен природен газ.\\nОбикновено местните чиновници предпочитат да мълчат за цената на разрешаването на трудностите, стоварени от Белия дом върху главите на обикновените европейци. В същото време, според западни журналисти, преодоляването на енергийната криза на 2022 г. ще струва на данъкоплатците в ЕС не по-малко от 1 трилион долара. При това разходите за внос на втечнен и тръбопроводен газ – за замяна на руския – вече са се утроили (до 208 милиарда долара). Предвижда се недостиг на енергийни ресурси, което налага потреблението да бъде нормирано, без да говорим за сериозно връщане назад от постигането на амбициозни климатични цели на фона на нарастващите емисии на парникови газове.\\nФактът, че основните бенефициенти на започнатата от Вашингтон кампания за борба с „ненадеждните“ доставчици са преди всичко най-големите американски горивни и енергийни корпорации, отдавна е „публична тайна“. В края на 2022 г. общите приходи на западните енергийни концерни скочиха с 48% до 3,6 трилиона долара Това, както и необходимостта от изграждане на скъпа въглеродно-интензивна енергийна инфраструктура, администрацията не е толкова склонна да разпространява.\\nДа наричаме нещата с истинските им имена. Това, което не може да бъде отнето на Белия дом, е много съмнителна „способност“ да създава образ на общ външен враг, за да започне тотално прекрояване на стоковите пазари. В същото време Съединените щати не се колебаят да извиват ръцете на своите съюзници, принуждавайки ги да се подписват под заробващите условия на договори за десетилетия напред.\\nОт своя страна Русия, като отговорна сила, винаги е предпочитала различен – основан на взаимна изгода – начин на енергийно сътрудничество с партньорите. Очевидно именно невъзможността за постигане на справедливи конкурентни предимства е принудила нашите недоброжелатели да предприемат радикални стъпки, като забрана за внос на местни продукти и въвеждане на прословутите „тавани на цените“ на въглеводородите.\\nАпотеозът на тези усилия е терористичната атака в Балтийско море срещу газопроводите от системата „Северен поток“. Събитията от последните седмици, включително многобройните „анонимни съобщения“ в местните медии, за пореден път потвърждават, че Белият дом не е заинтересован неприятната истина за поръчителите и извършителите на този саботаж да стане публично достояние.   \n",
