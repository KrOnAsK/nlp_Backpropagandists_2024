    - Theory 1: create_label_mapping
        - Until here, we give every narrative subnarrative pair that occurs a unique id. This is correct, the error is not here.
    - Theory 2: prepare_data
- Since we use the all data to create the label mapping, classes with 0 support can occur in the test set
