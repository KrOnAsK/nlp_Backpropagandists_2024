Which subtask do we use? 
-> Select subtask 2
We divide the work into work packages and work through the packages one after the other.
The deadline for all work packages is November 7, so that we can still talk to Varvara and have a buffer for improvements.

Tasks up to the first milestone:
	- Preprocessing the data (see Lecture 1 Preprocessing)
		○ Reading in the files (Leon)
		Subsistions & groups (Niklas)
		○ Text segmentation (Jonas)
		○ Text normalization (Sergej)
		Lemmitization & stemming (Leon)
		○ Push to Connlu format (?)
		Documentation (Jonas)
		○ Code cleaning (Sergej)

9 days until submission for 7-8 tasks. In order to finish as stress-free as possible, everyone should continue directly when the predecessor is finished.


Question to Varvara: What is a correct data format? ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a1f00b18-ed4a-48ba-9d73-ca6911bb8772)
